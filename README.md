# Final project - introduce to artificial intelligence course

In this project we had to implement 2 Bayesian infercene algorithms given a bayesian network:
- Bayesball
- Variable elimination
The bayesian network contains probabilistic relationships, which means every event has his distribution and the other events he is connected to.
We got a file which includes the network itself, and the questions we had to solve about the network. One type of the questions were solved by bayesball algorithm, and the other - bt variable elimination algorithm.

### Bayesball

The target of this algorithm is to solve the question: is event A is independent with event B ? is event A is independent with event B given another event?


### Variable elimination

The target of this algorithm is to return the probabily of some event a given anothe event
